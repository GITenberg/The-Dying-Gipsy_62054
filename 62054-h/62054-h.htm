</blockquote>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Conscience</span>, say some, is a mere
whim, that frightens weak minds, renders man a coward, and cuts
short half his purposes.&nbsp; But is it not rather the candle of
the Lord shining in man&rsquo;s dark bosom, to bring to light the
hidden wickedness of the heart; that well-known voice which gives
no sound, yet will be heard&mdash;that hand often felt, though
never seen?&nbsp; Reader! it you regard this inward monitor, (and
I trust you do,) you will not then turn away from the following
relation of facts.</p>
<p>Several reports were brought to P&mdash;, of a dying gipsy,
who was lying in a camp two miles off; that his mind was greatly
distressed at the prospect of death, that he had offered a sum of
money for a person to read to him a portion of the Bible, and
that he had also offered money to a poor woman for reading to him
part of the Book of Common Prayer; and further, that he had
declared he could not endure the thought of dying till God had
forgiven him.</p>
<p>Not being able that day to visit him myself, I prevailed on a
friend to go instead, to whom the gipsy gave an account of
himself in nearly the following words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My name is Stanley, my ancestors were once
respectable, my great-grandfather was a principal officer in the
army of the commonwealth; but the family falling to decay, my
father took up with the wandering life of the gipsies; among them
I was born, and have continued to the present time.&nbsp; I am
now in my eightieth year, and have led a long and wicked life;
but there is one thing that troubles me above all the rest.&nbsp;
About forty years ago, in the course of conversation with a
brother of mine, I <a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>cursed the Almighty to his face!&nbsp; From that time,
sir, I have been a stranger to peace; the recollection of my
blasphemy has followed me ever since; I cannot forget it; it
haunts me from place to place; alone or in company, it is the
same.&nbsp; I get no rest; my wickedness fills me with horror; I
am indeed a monster; often have I tried to remove the impression,
but it is impossible.&nbsp; O, sir, my sin it too heavy for me to
bear!&nbsp; Such has been its influence upon my spirits, that the
bare mention of God&rsquo;s name would bring a trembling upon me,
and fill my mind with anguish.&nbsp; As long as I could, I
concealed the cause of my uneasiness, till it became too painful
to bear, and I was at length induced, about two years ago, to
reveal it to my family; from that time I have earnestly sought
for God&rsquo;s forgiveness, but I still feel his hand
heavy.&nbsp; O might I but be pardoned! I could then die in
peace; but, sir, with this burden upon my soul, death will indeed
be dreadful.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having heard his affecting relation, my friend immediately
spoke of Jesus Christ&mdash;of his death on the cross for the
salvation of sinners, and exhorted him to believe in the Son of
God, who died for the sins of the world; assuring him, that there
was mercy with God to pardon him; that the divine compassion was
like the boundless sea; that the arms of Christ&rsquo;s mercy
were still extended to embrace and welcome all that come to him,
even the vilest; that many great sinners had been pardoned upon
repentance and were now shining in glory; that there was room
still for more, and that if he repented and believed in Christ as
the only Saviour, salvation was as free for him as for
others.&nbsp; At these words his countenance brightened; but as
speaking had by this time greatly exhausted him, my friend bade
him farewell for the present.</p>
<p>The next evening we visited him together; a small tent pitched
upon the ground, enclosing room just sufficient for a bed,
contained the sufferer.&nbsp; As we drew near, a young woman of
about twenty, in features, dress, and manners every way the
gipsy, came forward, and (as is frequently the case with
unenlightened relatives) wished us not to introduce the subject
of eternity any more.&nbsp; She said he had felt much more
composed in consequence of my friend&rsquo;s preceding visit, but
still she feared if we mentioned the subject then, it would again
disturb him; besides he was <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>already much fatigued.&nbsp; However,
on our replying that the tidings we brought were calculated to
soothe, instead of disturb, a person in his circumstances, she
drew the curtain from the front of the tent, and the object of
our attention lay before us, gasping for breath.</p>
<p>I confess I was much struck with the affectionate attention
the family appeared to pay to their aged father; however careless
of their own persons, they did not neglect him&mdash;there was
every thing that could be expected under such
circumstances&mdash;a feather bed, bolster, and pillows,
supported the limbs of the dying man&mdash;the sheets and
pillow-cases were white and clean, and a patchwork counterpane,
equally clean, covered him outside.</p>
<p>He immediately noticed us, and though nearly breathless made
an effort to speak; he replied to some of my friend&rsquo;s
questions concerning the subjects they had discoursed upon; said
that his mind was easier than it had ever been before&mdash;that
he felt as if a great weight had been lifted off from him.&nbsp;
We asked, &ldquo;What has been the practice of your past
life?&rdquo;&nbsp; He replied, &ldquo;Nothing but
sin.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;What do you deserve at the hands of
God?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Eternal
punishment.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Would God be just, if he were to
refuse you mercy?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;O
yes!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;If you should be spared and recover,
would you live as you have done?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;O no! not
for the world.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;What do you now desire? what
do you most need?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Mercy!
mercy!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;What, if you might be
pardoned?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;O I would give the world to obtain
it!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Are you then really desirous of pardon,
that you may join the redeemed in glory?&rdquo;&nbsp; To this he
signified his full assent, not indeed in so many words, they were
too feeble to convey his meaning; but with eyes and hands
uplifted, and a countenance remarkably animated, he seemed at
once to collect all the remaining energies of body and spirit to
say, &ldquo;O yes! indeed I am!&rdquo;&nbsp; This assent was
accompanied with a force of expression, which I apprehend none
but a dying man could give to it.</p>
<p>I again stated to him the plan of salvation, through the
redemption of Jesus Christ; the necessity of a change of heart to
render us meet for heaven; to all which he replied as
intelligibly as we could expect from his weak state and previous
ignorance, for he could not read a letter.&nbsp; I then stated to
him some of the invitations of divine mercy, as, Isaiah lv. 7,
&ldquo;Let the wicked forsake his way, and <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>the unrighteous
man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will
have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly
pardon.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, Isaiah i. 18, &ldquo;Come now, and let
us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as
scarlet, they shall be as while as snow; though they be red like
crimson, they shall be as wool.&rdquo;&nbsp; John vi. 37,
&ldquo;Him that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast
out.&rdquo;&nbsp; Matt. vii. 7, 8, &ldquo;Ask, and it shall be
given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened
unto you: for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that
seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be
opened.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rev. xxii. 17, &ldquo;And the Spirit and the
bride say, Come.&nbsp; And let him that heareth say, Come.&nbsp;
And let him that is athirst, come.&nbsp; And whosoever will, let
him take the water of life freely.&rdquo;&nbsp; I asked him if
they were not sweetly suited to the case of a penitent?&nbsp; He
replied, &ldquo;O yes!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Do they suit your
case?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;O very well!&rdquo;&nbsp; By this time
he was so much spent, that speaking appeared almost impossible; I
therefore kneeled down by him, and endeavoured in a short prayer
to plead the promises which are yea and amen in Christ Jesus, on
which we are encouraged to hope.&nbsp; We then left him, and he
expressed the sincerest gratitude for our attentions, as did his
family also.</p>
<p>As we turned away, my mind was deeply affected with the scene
which surrounded us; it was a fine evening in May, the landscape
was extensive, and richly diversified with sections of arable and
pasture land&mdash;the wide common on which we stood was skirted
on one side by a continuous range of hills, whose sloping sides
exhibited the various shades and hues peculiar to the season, as
seen in the fallow ground, the deep foliage of the copse, the
corn, the turnip, and the varying grass; while here and there, a
lengthened bank of chalk was seen beneath the frowning
precipice&mdash;in the distance, the parish church raised its
neat white spire above the trees&mdash;behind these, another
range of hills, though more irregular, stretched their encircling
arms so as completely to bound the prospect&mdash;the sky, with
the exception of a few light clouds, was clear and serene, and
the whole beautifully tinged with the rays of the selling
sun.</p>
<p>Such was the face of nature, which seemed suited in its
stillness to the solemn scene we had quitted.&nbsp; But with <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>man it was far
otherwise&mdash;a sad contrast now presented itself.&nbsp; In a
retired part of the common, beneath the shade of a few trees, we
had just seen a poor fellow-sinner (and we hope a penitent)
preparing to enter the presence of his Maker&mdash;the soul on
wing for flight, trembling, and anxious for the future&mdash;here
we had trodden the confines of eternity, and seemed to have been
breathing the air of death, and holding converse with the spirits
of another world; but at no great distance on the same common,
hundreds, who had assembled to celebrate the Whitsun holidays,
were wasting in giddy sinful mirth that precious time, which the
poor man we had just visited would have given the world to
recall.&nbsp; How sad a perversion of the sacred festival
appointed for the purpose of commemorating the descent of the
Holy Ghost!&mdash;that sacred Spirit, against whom this
thoughtless rabble were constantly striving, by stifling his
voice, and quenching his influence within them!&nbsp; Thus,
thought I, men sin; and thus, as in the agonies of that dying
man, they often suffer for it!&nbsp; But this is not all; he
will, we hope, find mercy, many of them perhaps will not&mdash;we
trust he is a penitent, he has rejoiced to hear of the Lamb of
God which taketh away the sins of the world; but who can say that
one fourth of that thoughtless crowd will ever repent?&nbsp; And
if not, these visionary joys must be succeeded by real and
everlasting misery.&nbsp; The thought affected me, and I felt
thankful for the grace, which I hoped had made me to differ.</p>
<p>The next day our penitent (for so we considered him) was again
visited by some of our friends, but was nearly speechless.&nbsp;
He lingered for a few days longer, and then died, we trust in
peace, through the infinite mercy of Christ.&nbsp; We learnt,
that for the last twelve years of his life he had been a very
altered man; and his family declared that since he had unbosomed
his sin and grief, they had often seen him under the hedges in
secret, as they thought, praying fervently for mercy.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Reader, we see in the case of this poor man,</p>
<p>First, The force of conscience.</p>
<p>Let it be remembered that this sin was committed in
private&mdash;his family knew nothing of it&mdash;his brother
probably did not notice it at the time&mdash;there was no man of
God at his elbow, to reprove him&mdash;no Bible at hand to <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>condemn
him&mdash;and yet he was never happy afterwards.&nbsp; What was
it, then, which made him thus miserable, and always thus brought
his sin to remembrance, but that same conscience, which so many
deny, and always affect to despise?&nbsp; Though there was no
recorder upon earth, there was one in heaven: God heard and
marked his sin: he it was that roused conscience to its duty, and
bid it wring the sinner&rsquo;s heart; it did so, and the unhappy
blasphemer could never afterwards forget the impious expression;
it was ever present to his recollection, it followed him like a
frightful spectre wherever he went, and peace was a stranger to
his bosom.</p>
<p>This it was that clothed death with so much terror: he could
not die as his fellows are used to die, in brutal ignorance and
stupidity; he was alive to his situation, he saw his danger; he
knew that punishment was deserved; conscience, ever pointing to
the bar of God, told him to prepare for judgment&mdash;and though
he knew but little of God&rsquo;s word and his threatenings
against sinners, he could not but fear the worst: it was this
that shook his strong nerves, and bowed down his spirits for
forty years.&nbsp; Oh! who can resist an enraged
conscience?&nbsp; &ldquo;A wounded spirit who can
bear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reader, pause for a moment.&nbsp; You possess a conscience,
though perhaps it sleeps, but be assured it will not sleep for
ever; it is immortal as the soul, it will surely awake, and that
soon, either in time or eternity: convinced of sin you must be,
either by the mercy of God in this world, to bring you to
repentance; or by his vengeance in the next, &ldquo;where their
worm dieth not, and their fire is not quenched!&rdquo;&nbsp; O
whenever it speaks, listen to it, it is a friendly voice: do not
stifle it, for in stilling conscience we quench the last
glimmerings of hope; we commit the last act of violence upon the
soul, short of self-murder; and do, as it were, leap down upon
the very shelvings of the pit, that mercy&rsquo;s hand may never
reach us.</p>
<p>Secondly.&nbsp; See here the bitterness of unpardoned sin.</p>
<p>God hath thus spoken by his prophet, (Jer. ii. 19.)
&ldquo;Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy
backslidings shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that it
is an evil thing and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy
God, and that my fear is not in thee, saith the Lord God of
hosts.&rdquo;&nbsp; This language was fearfully made out in <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>the case before
us: for forty years this man had no rest in his mind; he had
committed many sins before, which, like to many lying spirits,
had deceived him; but this sin as soon as committed, he felt to
lie upon his conscience unforgiven; and from that time forward
all his sins, which he once turned as sweet morsels under his
tongue, he found to be bitter as gall.&nbsp; His sufferings for
so many years together, may be better conceived than described;
wherever he went, whatever he did, he seemed to see the eye of
God continually fixed and frowning on him.&nbsp; Oh! if the
pressure of one unpardoned sin upon the conscience, be sufficient
to fill the soul with anguish, and render a man wretched through
life; what must be his sufferings in the world to come, where all
his sins will be brought to remembrance, and made to prey upon
his peace for ever!</p>
<p>Reader!&nbsp; You must sooner or later taste the bitterness of
sin.&nbsp; O that it may be in time to bring you to repentance
and salvation!&nbsp; But know, that if you die unpardoned, you
must dwell with devouring flame, and lie down in everlasting
burnings.</p>
<p>Thirdly.&nbsp; Notice signs of penitence.</p>
<p>His views of Christianity were indistinct and confused: this,
however, was to be expected from his habits of life.&nbsp; Up to
his eightieth year he had been a fugitive and wanderer upon
earth, without the means of grace; and there is reason to think,
without ever hearing a sermon in his life.&nbsp; And had he
possessed a Bible, he could not have read it: nothing therefore
but profound ignorance could be expected, but then, he exhibited
signs of the deepest penitence, and we know who has said,
&ldquo;The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a
contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.&rdquo; (Pa. li.
17.)&nbsp; Nor was this contrition the mere effect of his dying
circumstances; for some years previous he had been an altered
man, and had frequently been seen by his family, engaged in
prayer by himself under the hedges, and in other retired
places.&nbsp; I have certainly no warrant for positively
declaring that he is now happy; nor dare I say he is not;
&ldquo;to his own Master he standeth or falleth&rdquo;&mdash;but
when I heard of his death, I could not help, in the judgment of
charity tracing he departed spirit to the throne of God.</p>
<p>Reader are you thus penitent?&nbsp; Have you felt and <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>confessed your
sins?&nbsp; Have you earnestly implored mercy through the
atonement of Christ?&nbsp; Have you forsaken sin?&nbsp; For
remember, he declared as a dying man, that he would not repeat
his former practices, nor live as he had done for the
universe.&nbsp; If indeed you have forsaken your unrighteous
thoughts and ways, and turned to the Lord through faith in Jesus
Christ, he will assuredly receive you, and abundantly
pardon.&nbsp; But know, that if you still allow yourself to sin,
and still find sin pleasant, your state is truly awful, you are
as sure to die as he was, but not so likely to obtain mercy, for
he was penitent but you are not, and &ldquo;except ye repent, ye
shall all likewise perish.&rdquo; Luke xiii. 5.</p>
<p>Fourthly.&nbsp; We are herein reminded of the blessedness and
value of the Bible, which reveals a Saviour and the hope of
pardon.</p>
<p>It was not any thing of our own, but the truths of the Bible
which interested and cheered this dying man.&nbsp; With eagerness
he listened to the doctrines of redemption and mercy through the
blood of Christ, and found them exactly suited to his case.</p>
<p>O then how diligently ought we to study the Bible!&nbsp; Read
it, and pray over it; it will conduct thee to the fountain of
life and mercy.&nbsp; Remember, there is no salvation, no pardon,
but through that Saviour of whom it speaks, for &ldquo;there is
no other name given under heaven among men, whereby we must be
saved.&rdquo; (Acts iv. 12.)&nbsp; Mere sorrow for past, sin,
prompted by present pain, and dread of the future, forcing a cry
for mercy, cannot save us, nor must we trust to it: this man wept
and groaned for years but it brought him no relief&mdash;nothing
effected this but the hope of mercy through the Redeemer.</p>
<p>Sinner, go to Him; and may the divine Spirit seal these truths
upon thy heart, through Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Amen.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
